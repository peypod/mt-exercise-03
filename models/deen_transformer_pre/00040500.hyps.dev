as this country other countries , such as the civilian and democratic societies , the Americans that the right to the foundation of a trade - and that these trade activity negotiations as equally as equal partners with companies and registration - must be protected as equal partners with companies and registration .
after these rights in America , it is actually very much , the American ideal , in fact , the American ideal before eye , in order to deal with regard to the working population in a free and open society in a free and open society .
like Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
the history is a great majority .
now all , all , the strengthening the strength of the nation of the nation of the nation , but they are enlarged .
by reducing living in the standards of millions of work on the wonders for industry and the entire nation of the entire nation of production .
those who want to take the work of work , these simple truths , but the history remains .
the history reminds and that we should do .
the formal recognition of labelling rights , and enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights and enlargement of the protection of discrimination in the creation of workers .
